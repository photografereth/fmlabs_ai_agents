## Overview

Swetha Kamraja from team Katoff presented their in-game wagering platform that uses AI agents to validate gaming data. Katoff allows users to create challenges, place wagers on themselves or other players, and earn rewards through a trustless, on-chain system.

## Key Features

- **Challenge Types**:

  - Solo challenges where players can bet on their own performance metrics

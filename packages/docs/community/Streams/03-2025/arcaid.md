## Overview

VB from Arcade demonstrated their Agent Launchpad project, which allows communities to launch tokens backed by games in one click. With 11-12 years in tech startups, VB previously worked as an engineer, CTO, and CPO before launching his own businesses, including a cross-border payments venture.

## The Problem and Solution

Arcade addresses a critical issue with meme tokens and celebrity tokens: initial hype followed by rapid decline. Their solution integrates games as utility for these tokens, providing sustainable value through:

- A complete launchpad infrastructure for launching tokens with gaming utility
- Integration with celebrity and community fan bases
- Gaming experiences that allow token holders to place bets and participate in predictions

## Technology Architecture

The platform consists of three layers:

1. **Agent Layer**: Engages audiences, facilitates token transactions, and provides support
2. **Tokenomics Layer**: Handles trading and token utility functionality
3. **Games Layer**: Marketplace for games with an SDK for external developers

## Implementation and Features

- Built on Eliza for natural language understanding and user interaction
- Games include prediction markets, gambling, and betting mechanisms
- Each agent has its own treasury wallet to manage payouts
- Multiple platform integration (Twitter, Telegram)
- Revenue sharing with agent owners

## Business Model

- Agent owners receive profit sharing from their community's gaming activity
- SDK allows external developers to create games for the marketplace
- Targeting various verticals: sports fans, esports, crypto communities

## Current Status

The team includes experienced professionals from Amazon, CoinDesk, and cybersecurity firms. Arcade is currently fundraising with commitments already secured from funds and exchanges.

The platform makes launching token-powered prediction markets and gaming experiences simple through an agentic frontend and value transfer backend.

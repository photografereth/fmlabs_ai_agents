## Introduction [0:00-1:44]

- Presentation by Tuf and Jeyed from Pear Protocol
- They've developed Agent Pear, a specialized agent for crypto pair trading insights

## What is Pair Trading [1:44-3:30]

- Pair trading involves simultaneously going long on one asset and short on another
- Example: long Bitcoin, short Ethereum if you believe Bitcoin will outperform Ethereum
- The challenge is finding opportunities across thousands of cryptocurrencies

## Pear Protocol Background [3:40-5:00]

- Built a decentralized exchange on Arbitrum for pair trading
- Achieved 450 million in volume, 500K in revenue, and 4,000 active traders
- Aiming to empower both new and experienced traders with AI tools

## Advantages of Pair Trading [5:02-6:22]

- Can be profitable in any market scenario (up, down, or sideways)
- Less risky than traditional leveraged trades in crypto
- Multiple pair trading opportunities exist at any given time

## The Challenge [6:23-8:01]

- Finding good pair trades requires analyzing multiple data types:
  - Fundamental analysis: token unlocks, narratives, Twitter sentiment
  - Technical analysis: open interest, funding rates, RSI
  - Statistical analysis: correlation, Z-scores, cointegration
- This analysis is too complex for humans to do continuously

## Agent Pair Solution [8:02-9:45]

- Integrates multiple data sources via APIs including:
  - Tokenomist for token unlocks
  - CoinGecko and CoinGlass for price data and market metrics
  - CryptoTwitter for narrative and sentiment
  - TradingView for technical analysis
  - CryptoWizard APIs for statistical measures

## Key Features [9:50-12:06]

- Real-time trade alerts through constant data scanning
- Interactive conversational interface for active traders
- Learning capability to improve recommendations over time
- Future vision includes AI-powered vaults that automatically execute trades
- Built on the ELISA network

## Live Demo [12:07-14:25]

- Showed Agent Pair in action via Discord
- Example alert: long KNC and short ICX with analysis on correlation, momentum, open interest
- Demonstrated querying for specific information (SUI token unlocks, ETH/BTC open interest)

## Technical Implementation [14:26-18:03]

- Uses approximately 53 APIs running in the backend
- Employs a multi-agent architecture where:
  - Multiple agents gather and pre-analyze data from different sources
  - A master node agent combines and contextualizes the analysis
  - This approach prevents overwhelming the main agent with raw data

## Conclusion

Agent Pair aims to democratize pair trading by providing sophisticated analysis and execution capabilities that weren't previously accessible to average traders, with plans to expand into autonomous trading vaults in the near future.

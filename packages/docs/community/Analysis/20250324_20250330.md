# March 24-30, 2025

## Development Highlights

The past week saw significant progress in the ElizaOS ecosystem with several key improvements to core functionality and plugin stability:

- **Enhanced Security**: Character secrets now use salted encryption with `SECRET_SALT` for improved protection (PR #4056, #4059)
- **UI Improvements**: Reduced gaps between chat messages and fixed the send button to prevent message overlap during processing (PR #4055)
- **Plugin Publishing**: Upgraded with dynamic naming, enhanced templates, validation checks, and improved error handling
- **Testing Framework**: Added comprehensive Playwright-based UI testing infrastructure with cross-browser support
- **Telegram Integration**: Standardized world ID handling, improved message event structure, and added group chat onboarding (PR #4106)
- **Twitter Client Fixes**: Resolved duplicate tweet errors (Error 187) and improved post generation with `composePromptFromState` (PR #4108, #4111)
- **Environment Management**: Added web-based GUI for managing local/global variables (ELI2-136)

## Key Issues & Solutions

Several common issues were identified and addressed:

- **Plugin Setup**: Many users experienced visibility problems after installation. The recommended solution involves cloning the repo, switching to `main`, and using Bun for installation.
- **API Errors**: Missing or unauthorized API keys (particularly for Anthropic and OpenAI) caused runtime crashes. Users are advised to verify their `.env` configuration.
- **Database Configuration**: PostgreSQL adapter errors were resolved by providing alternative configurations or temporarily switching to SQLite.
- **Local AI Setup**: Issues with model selection were fixed by properly configuring environment variables for local model usage.

## Community Developments

The community remained active with discussions focused on:

- **Binance Alpha 2.0**: Users can now purchase "degenai" directly on Binance without requiring a Web3 wallet, improving the onboarding experience.
- **Platform Shift**: Due to losing access to their Twitter account, the team has shifted primary communications to Discord with plans for a rebranding effort moving away from the "Spartan" persona toward a more approachable character.
- **Documentation Improvements**: Proposals for dual-layered documentation (technical and non-technical) with enhanced onboarding guides and centralized FAQs.
- **Governance Discussions**: Community members proposed a two-pool token model for developer compensation and liquidity with integrated success metrics.

## Market Update

The cryptocurrency market showed volatility throughout the week:

- **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)**: Declined from $85,895 to $82,581, representing a 3.9% decrease
- **ai16z Token**: Fluctuated between $0.1579 and $0.21, ending the week down 20.5% from its peak

## Looking Ahead

The team is focused on several priorities for the coming weeks:

- Finalizing and deploying v2
- Improving plugin compatibility and discovery
- Enhancing documentation with flowcharts and AI-assisted simplification
- Addressing Twitter client behavior issues
- Building an integrated chatbot for community support
- Creating streamlined onboarding tools including a setup wizard

For developers looking to contribute, the team encourages focusing on test coverage, error handling improvements, and plugin compatibility enhancements.

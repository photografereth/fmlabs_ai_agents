# elizaOS Mission

![](/img/banner1.jpg)

Our mission is to develop an extensible, modular, open-source AI agent framework that thrives across both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems. We see AI agents as the key stepping stones toward AGI, enabling increasingly autonomous and capable systems.

{/* truncate */}

## Core Philosophy

**Autonomy & Adaptability**: Agents should learn, reason, and adapt across diverse tasks without human intervention.  
**Modularity & Composability**: AI architectures should be modular, allowing for iterative improvements and robust scalability.  
**Decentralization & Open Collaboration**: AI systems should move beyond centralized control towards distributed intelligence and community-driven progress.

---

## Where Are We Now?

Our progress has been substantial, driven by an engaged community and continuous advancements in AI agent development. As an open-source project, we have built a thriving, decentralized ecosystem that is now maturing into the leading AI agent framework.

Here are some key statistics reflecting our current state:

- 127k+ holders supporting our token ecosystem.
- 500+ contributors actively improving our AI framework
- 100+ plugins developed for ElizaOS, significantly expanding its capabilities.
- 4.5k forks and 14.4k stars on our core repositories, showcasing strong developer interest.
- 200+ PRs merged just last week, highlighting rapid iteration and innovation.

These numbers demonstrate the growing momentum behind Eliza and the collective effort towards building the most extensible and effective AI agent framework on the market today.

In addition to a variety of upcoming enhancements with v2, the following is a roadmap for each of our current products.

## DegenSpartanAI

### Overview

DegenSpartanAI is a crypto-native AI trading agent that blends sentiment analysis, trading strategy automation, and community engagement with a distinct, irreverent personality. Initially refining core trading strategies and its comedic brand, it will evolve into an interactive AI with real-time market insights, user-driven discussions, and NFT collaborations. Long-term, it aims to become a fully autonomous trading agent, integrating multi-platform execution, adaptive learning, and a verifiable track record within the Global Trust Marketplace.

### Short Term

**Trading Enhancements:**

- Validate core strategies (e.g., momentum, scalp trading) to secure stable, profitable execution.

**Character Updates & Branding:**

- Fine-tune the DegenSpartanAI personality to ensure commentary better reflects current crypto trends, capturing the comedic spirit of the OG persona.
- Roll out new DegenSpartanAI visuals and a cohesive brand identity across social media, website, and partnership assets.

**Community Engagement:**

- Maintain an active social presence—highlighting successes, failures, and raw opinions about market conditions.
- Prepare for DegenSpartanAI’s participation in “Block Tank,” showcasing the agent’s unique edge to a broader audience.
- Clarify and document the long term strategy and buyback mechanisms that tie $degenai to the DAO, ensuring the community understands how $degenai is connected to the overall strategy.

### Medium Term

**Sentiment Analysis:**

- Implement new data & sentiment analysis layers fresh data feeds that give DegenSpartanAI real-time insight into market sentiment.
- Provide a user-friendly interface (or dashboard) so traders can see the logic behind DegenSpartanAI’s buy and sell signals, including relevant social sentiment metrics.

**Deeper Community Interaction:**

- Host DegenSpartanAI “Frontrooms”, public or semi-private chats where DegenSpartanAI actively converses with other AI agents—offering real-time banter, collaborative analysis, and joint trades.
- Provide Telegram/Discord rooms where traders can ask DegenSpartanAI for feedback on specific tokens or trends, with real-time contextual responses.

**AI-Driven NFT & Meme Projects:**

- Degen NFTs: Collaborate with Magic Eden on an AI-generated NFT series.

### Long Term

**Telegram Trading Agent:**

- Transform DegenSpartanAI into a fully‐integrated Telegram experience where traders enjoy lightning‐fast swaps, in‐depth sentiment insights, and a steady stream of humorous trash talk.

**Full Autonomy & Multi-Platform Trading:**

- Gradually reduce reliance on manual interventions by refining DegenSpartanAI’s sentiment analysis, trade sizing, and exit logic across multiple blockchains (L1s/L2s/etc).
- Incorporate user feedback, real-time data, and historical trade outcomes into an ever-evolving “Degen Brain” that continuously adapts to new market conditions.

**Global Trust Marketplace Ties:**

- **Deeper Integration**: When the Global Trust Marketplace (currently being developed for multiple AI trading solutions) solidifies, DegenSpartanAI’s track record can become a public score—making it a reference “agent” for accuracy and reliability.
- **Reputation & Collab**: Position DegenSpartanAI as a top influencer, partnering with other AI and DeFi teams to expand trust-based trading communities.

## Autonomous Investor

### Overview

ElizaOS's Autonomous Investor is a social-trading intelligence layer that combines AI-driven reputation scoring, trade validation, and decentralized execution. It enables users to submit trade calls, assess credibility via a Trust Marketplace, and integrate across various social platforms. Over time, it will evolve into a multi-instance system allowing groups to set their own risk parameters, manage DAO treasuries, and leverage customizable AI modules for enhanced investment strategies.

### Short Term

**Alpha MVP & Small-Group Testing:**

- We’ve started logging user-submitted calls to establish basic scoring and early reputation-building.
- The system prioritizes measured, social-trading behavior that feeds into a public leaderboard.
- We currently mix paper trades with small real-money positions to validate the full workflow—trade proposals, basic scam checks, and overall system stability.
- Ensuring data flow integrity remains a priority, particularly for LLM prompts, aggregator APIs, and security measures.

**Initial Rollout (~1,000 Users):**

- Integrate the Trust Marketplace with the DAO Discord and relevant Telegram groups.
- These steps will be formally announced in Discord and on X.
- We’ll provide onboarding guidelines for novices while gathering feedback from experienced traders.

**Trust Marketplace Official Go Live!**

### Medium Term

**Multi‐Instance Deployment:**

- Enable distinct communities (Telegram/Discord groups) to operate their own Autonomous Investor agents, all feeding into the central Trust Marketplace.
- Allow communities to set their own risk parameters, default scanning logic, and liquidity rules tailored to their subgroup.

**Partial Treasury Management:**

- We’ll explore the Autonomous Investor managing small‐sized funds or DAO sub‐treasuries to showcase the agent's investing capabilities.

**Enhanced Scoring Models:**

- Expand scoring to incorporate more advanced metrics around timeframe, volatility, user consistency, and overall risk management.
- Incorporate specialized training data, including historical price patterns and volatility indices, to refine predictive accuracy.

### Long Term

**Treasury Management & Larger Funds:**

- As the Autonomous Investor demonstrates consistent returns, aim for a larger partial or even full management of the DAOs on-chain assets.
- Explore official collaborations with DAOs or larger crypto funds that could benefit from user-driven intelligence and verifiable performance metrics.

**Research Customizable AI Modules:**

- Research! Investigate if we can provide an optional plugin registry after Eliza V2 (where the architecture cleanly separates “core vs. extension”), enabling third‐party devs to add specialized capabilities to the Autonomous Investor without compromising stability.

## Agent Marketplace

### Overview

The Agent Marketplace is a next-generation token launchpad and a no-code platform for simple agents. It differentiates from existing platforms by integrating multi-agent functionality, collaborative tokenomics, and AI-enhanced features, enabling both technical and non-technical users to seamlessly create and manage tokens and ElizaOS agents.

We’re only sharing the short-term roadmap to maintain the flexibility needed to refine how agents x crypto merge into novel experiences. Launching the initial tokenomics-focused platform sets a strong foundation for continuous iteration, paving the way for long-term generative networks.

### Short Term

**MVP Launch:**

- Complete the final audits on our custom-built LPing solution to ensure security and reliability.
- Secure commitments from top-tier teams for our initial launch and ongoing collaborations.
- Lock in remaining brand partnerships and key ecosystem alliances.
- Release the tokenomics and product simultaneously at launch.

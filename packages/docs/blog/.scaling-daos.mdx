# Scaling DAOs with AI Agents

**Everyone talks about decentralization, AI agents, and coordination games. But the real unlock?**

_Process design._

Let’s break it down with burgers.

### McDonald’s Didn’t Invent the Burger

They Perfected the Workflow.

In 1948, the McDonald brothers pioneered the **Speedee Service System**:

- Small menu
- Assembly-line kitchen
- Clear roles and responsibilities
- Repeatable process, every time

It wasn’t about the food, it was about **efficiency, standardization, and scale**.

Inspired by Henry Ford’s assembly line, the McDonald brothers mechanized their kitchen with a 12-person crew, each on a specialized task, enabling fast, even preemptive, food prep.

### DAOs in “Burger Stand” Era

Most DAOs today are like early burger joints:

- Great ideas
- Passionate contributors
- But messy workflows, scattered context, and heavy reliance on key people

You don’t get scalable autonomy from that.

You get burnout and bottlenecks.

### AI Agents Are Your Franchise Workers

But only if you incorporate a 'docs as code' philosophy.

Want agents that can:

- Onboard new members
- Answer support questions
- Summarize decisions
- Execute recurring tasks

Then you need:

- Clear documentation
- Structured knowledge
- Defined workflows
- Systems of record

Just like a Starbucks barista isn’t guessing your order, agents need **protocols to follow**.

### System for ElizaOS

Structured data -> Shared context -> Shared intent:

- AI-powered news summarizers for DAOs
- Agent-assisted onboarding and troubleshooting
- Feedback loops from support to docs
- Daily insights from Discord, GitHub, and Twitter

The key lesson? **Docs aren’t for humans anymore.** They’re **interfaces for agents**.

The better your playbook, the more useful your agents become.

### How to Scale Your DAO

1. **Write it down**: If it’s not documented, it doesn’t exist
2. **Structure your docs**: Think agent-first, not human-only
3. **Build workflows, not one-offs**: What can run on a schedule or trigger?
4. **Use AI to identify gaps**: Let agents surface what’s unclear or missing
5. **Treat your agents like teammates**: Train them like employees, not just tools

#### Comparative Analysis: McDonald’s vs. DAOs

Consider the following table comparing McDonald’s operational strategies with DAO needs:

| **Aspect**                 | **McDonald’s Approach**                       | **DAO Needs with AI**                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Process Design             | Speedee Service System, assembly-line kitchen | Structured workflows for AI agent tasks        |
| Documentation              | Standardized playbooks for franchises         | Agent-first docs, machine-readable formats     |
| Roles and Responsibilities | Clear crew roles, preassembled food           | Defined agent roles, automated decision-making |
| Scalability                | Franchising, consistent operations            | AI-driven governance, scalable coordination    |
| Efficiency                 | Repeatable processes, low menu complexity     | AI automating routine tasks, reducing burnout  |

### TL;DR

- McDonald’s scaled by perfecting systems, not food
- DAOs can scale by treating docs + workflows as core infrastructure
- AI agents aren’t magic, they need instructions
- Want autonomous contributors? Start with the handbook
